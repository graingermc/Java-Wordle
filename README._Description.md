Just a project I dedcided to do for fun. Definitely includes some redundancies and inefficiencies but I enjoyed the practice. Only halfway through a highschool computer science class and found a way to spend my free time.
Would be possible to make the program not accept any answer that is not within the extensive word list, similarly to the real wordle, but I decided to leave it out as it would be too restricting without a large word file. 
Enjoy!
